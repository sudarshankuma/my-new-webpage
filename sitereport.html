	<p>This is an assignment given by University of Northampton via Nami College to each and every individual
		students of Bsc Computing.<br>It was given in 11 may 2021A.D.Objective of this assignment was to check whether
		students are capable or not to create a webpage using HTML and CSS along with managing code using Git/GitHub.</p><br>
		<p>To be honest,before this assignment i didnt know how to design webpages and also headache but i tried my best to create 
			this project after spending sometime ,i make it to the flow and everything was accurate and built desire to do more.</p><br>
			<p>In my opinion,lecture and the tutorial which were taught and done in the college helped alot and besides that some of the websites and online tutorail gave some tips to complete this assignment.<br>Module tutor(Mr. Thapa) used to provide slides of a lecture which was very helpful. This was possible all due to the patience og Mr Thapa.<br>
			Here are some of the explanations of designs,fonts,color and links which were used to make this webpage:</p><br>
			<h3>Navigation Bar:</h3>
			<p>Like,for every websites navigation bar is mandatory and here is also navigation bar available to visit diffrrent pages
				(Home,Portfolio,Contact,CV,Sitereport).<br>And the bars are in black color eith white background having equal font sizes along with active class and hover.In this part , background color looks like sky blue color<br> i.e.gray which makes much more attractive.</p><br>
